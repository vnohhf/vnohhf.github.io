## Finished Projects

1.	### [Detections of Dust in the Outskirts of M31 and M33](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/abccc4) <sub>*(Published in ApJL)*</sub>
    We using about 0.2 million stars selected from the LAMOST data and combining precise photometry and parallaxes from the Gaia DR2, we have constructed a two-dimensional foreground dust reddening map toward the M31 and M33 region. From our revealed map of extragalactic dust, we found the dust disks of M31 and M33 extend to about 2.5 times their optical radius. A large amount of dust is detected in the M31 halo out to over 100 kpc.

2.	### [Stellar Color Loci of Red Giant Stars in SDSS Stripe 82](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1674-4527/21/12/319) <sub>*(Published in Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics (RAA))*</sub>
    We present the metallicity-dependent Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) stellar color loci of red giant stars, using a spectroscopic sample of red giants in the SDSS Stripe 82. With good photometry, photometric metallicities of red giants can be reliably determined to an accuracy of 0.2 â€“ 0.25 dex, comparable to the precision achievable with low-resolution spectroscopy for a signal-to-noise ratio of 10. We also propose a new technique to discriminate between red giants and MS stars based on the SDSS photometry. The technique achieves completeness of âˆ¼70 percent and efficiency of âˆ¼80 percent in selecting metal-poor red giant stars of \[Fe/H\] â‰¤ â€“1.2.

3.	### [Empirical Temperature- and Extinction-Dependent Extinction Coefficients](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ac9dfa) <sub>*(Published in ApJS)*</sub>
    We have obtained accurate dust reddening from far-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared for up to 5 million stars by the star-pair algorithm based on LAMOST stellar parameters along with GALEX, Pan-STARRS 1, Gaia, SDSS, 2MASS, and WISE photometric data. And we derived the empirical reddening coefficients for 21 colors both in the traditional (single-valued) way and as a function of \\\({\rm T_{eff}}\\\) and E(B-V). Comparisons with measurements in the literature show that the \\\({\rm T_{eff}}\\\) - and E(B-V)-dependent coefficients explain the discrepancies between different measurements naturally, i.e., using sample stars of different temperatures and reddening. A Python package [`extinction_coefficient`](https://github.com/vnohhf/extinction_coefficient) is also provided for using the coefficients.

4.	### [An Rv Map of the Milky Way Revealed by LAMOST](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/acf764) <sub>*(Published in ApJS)*</sub>
    By utilizing accurate color excess measurements from the optical to the mid-infrared range, we have derived \\\(R_{V}\\\) values for approximately three million stars from LAMOST DR7 using a forward-modeling technique. This extensive data set enables us to construct a comprehensive 2D \\\(R_{V}\\\) map of the Milky Way within the LAMOST footprint at a spatial resolution of âˆ¼27.'5. Based on reliable sight lines of E(Bâˆ’V)>0.1, we find that \\\(R_{V}\\\) exhibits a Gaussian distribution centered around 3.25 with a standard deviation of 0.25. The spatial variability of \\\(R_{V}\\\) in the Galactic disk exhibits a wide range, spanning from small scales within individual molecular clouds to large scales up to kiloparsecs. A striking correlation is observed between the distribution of \\\(R_{V}\\\) and molecular clouds. Notably, we observe lower \\\(R_{V}\\\) values within the regions of nearby molecular clouds compared to their surrounding areas. Furthermore, we have investigated the relationships between \\\(R_{V}\\\) and various parameters, including dust temperature, dust emissivity spectral index, column densities and ratios of atomic and molecular hydrogen, as well as the gas-to-dust ratio. We find that these relationships vary with the level of extinction. These analyses provide new insights into the properties and evolution of dust grains in diverse interstellar environments and also hold significant importance for achieving accurate extinction corrections.

5. ### [An Empirical Extinction Curve Revealed by Gaia XP Spectra and LAMOST](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad613e) <sub>*(Published in ApJ)*</sub>
    We present a direct measurement of extinction curves using corrected Gaia XP spectra of the common sources in Gaia DR3 and LAMOST DR7. Our analysis of approximately 370,000 high-quality samples yielded a high-precision average extinction curve for the Milky Way. After incorporating infrared photometric data from Two Micron All Sky Survey and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the extinction curve spans wavelengths from 0.336 to 4.6 Î¼m. We determine an average R55 of 2.730 Â± 0.007, corresponding to RV = 3.073 Â± 0.009, and a near-infrared power-law index Î± of 1.935 Â± 0.037. Our study confirmed some intermediate-scale structures within the optical range. One new feature was identified at 540 nm, and its intensity exhibited a correlation with extinction. This extinction curve can be used to investigate the characteristics of dust and enhance the extinction correction of Milky Way stars. A Python package for this extinction curve is available.
